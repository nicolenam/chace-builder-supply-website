# Chace Building Supply Website Optimization

This repository contains the analysis, proposed optimizations, and updated code for the Chace Building Supply website optimization project. The goal of this project is to improve the website's performance, semantic structure, and search engine optimization (SEO) while adhering to the TOOLBX design standards.

## Analysis

The existing Chace Building Supply website has been neglected for years, resulting in slow page load times and a lack of proper semantic structure. To address these issues, the following optimizations have been identified:

1. **Page Load Time Optimization**: The website's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code will be optimized to reduce page load time. Techniques such as minification, compression, and efficient use of browser caching will be employed.

2. **Semantic Structure Enhancement**: The website's markup will be enhanced to adhere to semantic HTML practices. Proper usage of HTML5 structural elements like header, nav, main, and footer will be implemented to improve readability and accessibility.

3. **SEO Optimization**: The current markup will be evaluated for SEO deficiencies and improvements will be made. This includes using appropriate heading tags, meta tags, and structured data markup to enhance the website's visibility in search engine rankings.
